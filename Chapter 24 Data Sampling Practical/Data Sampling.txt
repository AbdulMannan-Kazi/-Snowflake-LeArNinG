                                    Data Sampling - ROW , BLOCK 
                =============================================================

-- Sampling method is optional. If no method is specified, the default is BERNOULLI.

1. BERNOULLI (or ROW): Includes *each row with a probability of p/100. Similar to flipping a weighted coin for each row.

2. SYSTEM (or BLOCK): Includes each *block of rows with a probability of p/100. This method does not support fixed-size sampling.

3. REPEATABLE | SEED ( seed ) : Specifies a seed value to make the sampling deterministic. Can be any integer 

-- The following keywords can be used interchangeably:
    SAMPLE | TABLESAMPLE
    BERNOULLI | ROW
    SYSTEM | BLOCK
    REPEATABLE | SEED

-- The number of rows returned depends on the sampling method specified :

1.  Fraction-based : - 
    -- If no seed is specified, SAMPLE generates different results when the same query is repeated.
    -- If a table does not change, and the same seed and probability are specified, SAMPLE generates the same result.
    -- However, sampling on a copy of a table might not return the same result as sampling on the original table, even if the same

ROW -- Return a sample of a table in which *each row has a 20.3% probability of being included in the sample:
      select * from testtable tablesample bernoulli (20.3);

BLOCK -- Return a sample of a table in which each *block of rows has a 3% probability of being included in the sample, and set the seed to 82:
       select * from testtable sample system (3) seed (82);

2.  Fixed-size : -
-- If the table is larger than the requested number of rows, the number of requested rows is always returned.
-- If the table is smaller than the requested number of rows, the entire table is returned.

-- examples : 
select * from example_table sample system (10 rows);
select * from example_table sample row (10 rows) seed (99);

-- Sampling with a seed is not supported on views or subqueries
select * from (select * from example_table) sample (1) seed (99);

-- SYSTEM | BLOCK and seed are not supported for *fixed-size sampling


Some Examples:

1. select * from tablename sample row(10);  -- Return a sample with 10% of rows

2. select * from tablename tablesample block (20); -- Return a sample with data from 20% blocks

-- Return a sample with data from 10% of blocks and guarantees same data set if we use seed 111 next time
3. select * from tablename sample system (10) seed (111) ;

4. select * from tablename tablesample (100); -- Return an entire table, including all rows into the sample

5. select * from tablename sample row (0);  -- Return an empty sample -- No need 

6. select * from tablename sample (10 rows);  -- Return a fixed-size sample of 10 rows

create or replace schema sample_dt;

-- from customer_csv table 
select * from customer_csv sample row (10);  -- use limit also here -- % of rows
select * from customer_csv sample block (10);  --  % from block of rows

-- just selecting sample data from snowflake demo db
select * from snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf10.customer  -- 150,019
    sample bernoulli (10);

select * from snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf10.customer  -- 82,500 
    sample system (5) seed (111);
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Creating tables with sample data 
1. FRACTION SAMPLING

-- bernoulli or row ------ APPROX SAME SAME
create table customer_1 as
select * from snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf10.customer   -- 1,500,000
    sample (10);
    
create table customer_2 as
select * from snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf10.customer  -- 150,321 
    sample row (10);
    
select count(1) from snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf10.customer; -- 1500000
select count(1) from customer_1;  -- 150419
select count(1) from customer_2;  -- 150035

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- system or block     -- HAVE MORE DIFF in comparison with ROW method
create table customer_3 as
select * from snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf10.customer  -- 79,500
    sample block (10);
    
create table customer_4 as
select * from snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf10.customer  -- 82,500
    sample system (5) seed (111);

select count(1) from snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf10.customer;  --1500000
select count(1) from customer_3;  -- 82500
select count(1) from customer_4;  -- 82500

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. FIXED SAMPLING

-- sample with fixed number of rows
create table customer_5 as
select * from snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf10.customer  -- 1000 fixed
    sample row (1000 rows);
    
select count(1) from customer_5;  -- 1000 fixed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    

-- check the seed is same or not
select * from customer_4
minus
select * from snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf10.customer
    sample system (5) seed (111); -- same  -- 0 rows means no difference
    
select * from customer_3
minus
select * from snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf10.customer
    sample system (5) seed (111); -- not same
